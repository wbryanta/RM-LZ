    LandingZone helps you find the perfect settlement location by filtering world tiles based on climate, terrain, resources, and geographic features.

Key Features:
• 12 Curated Presets - One-click configurations for different playstyles and in-game experiences. Modify those, and/or create and save your own.
• Advanced Mode - 50+ filter criteria organized across 6 intuitive tabs (Climate &amp; Weather, Terrain &amp; Water, Resources &amp; Production, Structures &amp; Events, Biome Control, Results &amp; Recovery)
• Live Selectivity Feedback - Real-time tile count estimates and restrictiveness warnings as you configure filters
• Intelligent Fallback Tiers - Progressive loosening when your ideal configuration has zero results
• Bookmarks - Save and name interesting tile locations for later comparison and reference
• Two-Phase Architecture - Efficient filtering and ranking of thousands of tiles in seconds

The mod seamlessly integrates with RimWorld's world generation screen, adding a preferences button to the bottom ribbon.
