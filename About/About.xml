    [DEVELOPMENT VERSION - DO NOT USE FOR NORMAL PLAY]

This is the development version of LandingZone with Source/, Managed/, and other dev files. Use the regular "LandingZone" mod for normal gameplay.

    LandingZone helps you find the perfect settlement location by filtering world tiles based on climate, terrain, resources, and geographic features.

This is a beta release. While heavily tested with a wide range of popular mods, there are likely things to add, edit, remove, improve, etc. I will rely heavily on your feedback in Workshop or via https://github.com/wbryanta/RM-LZ

Key Features:
• 12 Curated Presets - One-click configurations for different playstyles and in-game experiences. Modify those, and/or create and save your own.
• Advanced Mode - 50+ filter criteria organized across 5 tabs (Climate, Geography, Resources, Features, Results)
• Live Selectivity Feedback - Real-time tile count estimates and restrictiveness warnings as you configure filters
• Intelligent Fallback Tiers - Progressive loosening when your ideal configuration has zero results
• Bookmarks - Save and name interesting tile locations for later comparison and reference
• Two-Phase Architecture - Efficient filtering and ranking of thousands of tiles in seconds

The mod seamlessly integrates with RimWorld's world generation screen, adding a preferences button to the bottom ribbon.
